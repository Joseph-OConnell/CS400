There once was a cat
his name was Matt.
Matt was a fat cat.
Matt the fat cat,
took a great fall,
and landed on a ball.
The ball was owned by paul.
Paul is a dog.
He went to lay on his log.  

Paul's dad was on a jog.
Amidst a lot of fog.
Fog took away the log
Hence, Paul also hopped on a jog
to find another log.
The ball was nowhere to be found.
Paul heard a sound.

He had no idea to where he was bound.
Paul kept searching the ground
Paul found his log
Next to something fat.
Would you look at that?
It's his friend Matt
What a silly cat.
Let's go back home.
