There once was a cat
his name was Matt.
Matt was a fat cat.
Matt the fat cat,
took a great fall,
and landed on a ball.
The ball was owned by paul.
Paul is a dog.
He went to lay on his log.  
Paul's dad was on a jog.
Amidst a lot of fog.
Fog took away the log
Hence, Paul also hopped on a jog
to find another log.
